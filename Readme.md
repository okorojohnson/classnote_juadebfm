# JavaScript-Practice-Notes

This repo is for extra notes as discussed in our classes so far. Explanations, examples and projects done in class will be updated in this file weekly.

Take this as a gift from me to you, you can clone the repo, star it or download it for your purview as i might not be keeping it public for too long
